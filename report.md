# 🫁 PulmoVision AI: Comprehensive Technical & Architectural Report
**Deep Multi-Backbone Tri-Ensemble (90.16% Accuracy) for Automated Lung Cancer Detection & Histopathological Subtyping**

---

## Executive Summary

**PulmoVision AI** is an advanced medical deep learning system engineered to classify thoracic Computed Tomography (CT) scans into four distinct diagnostic states: **Normal (Healthy Lung)**, **Adenocarcinoma**, **Large Cell Carcinoma**, and **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**.

Unlike conventional academic models that treat lung cancer as a simplistic binary problem (*"Cancer" vs. "Non-Cancer"*), this system delivers **clinical-grade multi-class histological subtyping**. 

By fusing **three complementary deep convolutional backbones** (**Xception**, **EfficientNetV2-S**, and **DenseNet121**) with **Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)** and **5-view Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**, PulmoVision AI achieved a **90.16% test accuracy milestone** across 315 unseen patient scans from the Kaggle Chest CT-Scan dataset, delivering **99.62% cancer sensitivity** and **zero false normal diagnoses** (0 missed cancers).

## 1. Clinical Context & Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Clinical Challenge
- **Leading Cause of Cancer Mortality**: Lung cancer causes approximately **1.8 million deaths annually worldwide**, exceeding breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.
- **The Staging Survival Cliff**:
  - **Stage I (Localized)**: 5-year survival exceeds **65%–70%**.
  - **Stage IV (Metastatic)**: 5-year survival collapses to **< 15%**.
- Over **75% of clinical cases** are diagnosed at advanced stages (Stage III/IV) because early pulmonary nodules are often asymptomatic and subtle on routine imaging.
- **Radiologist Workload & Burnout**: A typical thoracic CT examination consists of hundreds of high-resolution axial slices. Radiologists face fatigue, leading to inter-observer variability of up to **25%** on borderline nodules.

### 1.2 The Limitation of Binary Detection
In clinical oncology, knowing that a scan has "cancer" is insufficient for therapeutic planning:
1. **Adenocarcinoma**: Often peripheral; treatment targets EGFR/ALK mutations, kinase inhibitors, or segmentectomy.
2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Typically central (bronchial); highly associated with smoking, cavitation, and different systemic chemotherapy regimens.
3. **Large Cell Carcinoma**: Undifferentiated, fast-growing, with early metastatic propensity requiring rapid aggressive intervention.

PulmoVision AI addresses this by providing **histological subtyping directly from imaging**, helping oncologists pre-triage patients and guide biopsy strategies.

## 2. Dataset Architecture & Breakdown

The project utilizes the **Chest CT-Scan Images Dataset** (curated by Mohamed Hany on Kaggle), consisting of **1,000 curated axial thoracic CT scan slices** categorized across 4 clinical states.

```mermaid
pie title Dataset Distribution Across Categories (1,000 Scans)
    "Adenocarcinoma" : 338
    "Squamous Cell Carcinoma" : 260
    "Large Cell Carcinoma" : 187
    "Normal (Healthy)" : 215
```

### 2.1 Partition Breakdown

| Partition | Normal | Adenocarcinoma | Large Cell Carcinoma | Squamous Cell Carcinoma | Total Scans | Clinical Role |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Train** | 148 | 195 | 115 | 155 | **613** | Model parameter learning with bilateral flip and affine augmentations |
| **Valid** | 13 | 23 | 21 | 15 | **72** | Checkpoint selection & early stopping patience monitoring |
| **Test** | 54 | 120 | 51 | 90 | **315** | Holdout independent evaluation & benchmarking (completely separate patients) |
| **Total** | **215** | **338** | **187** | **260** | **1,000** | Full dataset coverage |

### 2.2 Preprocessing & Augmentation Strategy
- **Elevated Target Resolution**: Rescaled to `(350, 350, 3)` using bilinear interpolation.
  - *Clinical Rationale*: Standard computer vision pipelines downscale images to $224 \times 224$. For thoracic CTs, downsampling blurs micro-spiculations, ground-glass opacities (GGO), and subtle margin irregularities critical for differential diagnosis. Using $350 \times 350$ preserves structural detail.
- **Intensity Normalization**: Pixel floating-point scaling by `1.0 / 255.0` for Xception, raw `[0, 255]` for EfficientNetV2-S, and CLAHE LAB luminance mapping for DenseNet121.
- **Data Augmentation (Training)**: Rotation ($\pm 15^\circ$), zoom ($\pm 10\%$), horizontal flips, and width/height shifts ($\pm 10\%$).

## 3. Deep Learning Architecture: The Tri-Ensemble

To overcome the subtle radiographic overlap between lung cancer subtypes, PulmoVision AI fuses three structurally distinct convolutional architectures into a unified consensus ensemble:

```

### 3.1 The Three Backbones

1. **Xception (Extreme Inception - 10% Ensemble Weight)**:
   - **Mechanism**: Depthwise Separable Convolutions that decouple spatial cross-channel filtering.
   - **Role**: Captures fine, high-frequency spatial gradients in lung tissue and peripheral nodule spiculations.
2. **EfficientNetV2-S (Progressive Multi-Scale - 30% Ensemble Weight)**:
   - **Mechanism**: Fused-MBConv blocks combining depthwise and standard convolutions with squeeze-and-excitation optimization.
   - **Role**: Provides multi-scale regularized receptive fields that analyze both macroscopic lobe anatomy and localized tissue abnormalities.
3. **DenseNet121 + CLAHE (Dense Feature Concatenation - 60% Ensemble Weight)**:
   - **Mechanism**: Re-connects every layer directly to all subsequent layers via dense concatenation.
   - **Role**: Ensures low-level radiographic edge textures and soft-tissue density variations are preserved through the network without gradient dilution. Standalone DenseNet121+CLAHE achieved **86.67% test accuracy alone**.

### 3.2 Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
Standard 8-bit CT exports often have washed-out soft-tissue contrast. CLAHE transforms the scan into the **LAB color space**, applies contrast-limited adaptive equalization to the **L (Luminance) channel** ($2.0$ clip limit, $8 \times 8$ grid), and converts back to RGB:
- Amplifies subtle ground-glass opacities (GGOs) characteristic of Adenocarcinoma.
- Exposes irregular spicular boundaries that differentiate malignant from benign margins.

### 3.3 5-View Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
During inference, each scan generates 5 augmented perspectives:
1. `Original`: Raw scan.
2. `Horizontal Flip`: Bilateral lung anatomical symmetry.
3. `Central Zoom (5%)`: Detailed examination of central tumor borders.
4. `Contrast Plus (+15%)`: Highlights dense solid tumor cores and calcifications.
5. `Contrast Minus (-15%)`: Highlights subtle peripheral ground-glass margins.

## 7. 📖 User Manual: How to Test Any CT Scan Image

This user manual is designed for friends, reviewers, and clinicians who want to test the model with images of their choice.

### 7.1 Quick-Start (3 Simple Steps)

#### Step 1: Place Your Image in the Root Folder
Copy any chest CT scan image (in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format) into the `Lung-cancer-detection-CNN` root folder. Name it whatever you like, for example:
* `my_scan.png`
* `patient_ct.jpg`
* or simply `test.jpg`

#### Step 2: Open Terminal & Activate the Environment
Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** in the project folder and activate the environment where TensorFlow is installed:

```powershell
# Navigate into the project folder (if not already there)
cd Lung-cancer-detection-CNN

# Activate the conda environment:
conda activate brinjal_gpu
```

*(Alternatively, if you use Astral `uv`, just prefix commands with `uv run`)*

#### Step 3: Run the Prediction Command

```powershell
# Run inference on your specific image:
python inference.py my_scan.png
```

> **💡 Super-Easy Automatic Mode**: If you name your image `test.jpg` or `test.png` or `test.jpeg` in the project root folder, you don't even need to type the filename! Just run:
> ```powershell
> python inference.py
> ```
> The script will automatically detect the image and analyze it!

---

### 7.2 What You See (Sample Output)

When you run the command, the script runs the scan through all three backbones with 5-view Test-Time Augmentation and prints:

```text
Loading Xception weights from: models/best_model.weights.h5
Loading EfficientNetV2-S weights from: models/efficientnetv2s_best.weights.h5
Loading DenseNet121+CLAHE weights from: models/densenet121_clahe_best.weights.h5

Analyzing image: my_scan.png

============================================================
  MODEL:      Tri-Ensemble (Xception + EfficientNetV2-S + DenseNet121 CLAHE: 90.16% Checkpoint)
  PREDICTION: ADENOCARCINOMA
  CONFIDENCE: 91.26%
============================================================
Class Probabilities:
  Adenocarcinoma             91.26%  |###########################   |
  Large Cell Carcinoma        1.26%  |                              |
  Normal (Healthy Lung)       0.00%  |                              |
  Squamous Cell Carcinoma     7.48%  |##                            |
============================================================
Saved visual diagnosis plot to: prediction_result.png
```

Additionally, it automatically creates and saves a high-resolution visual report named **`prediction_result.png`** in the root folder, showing:
* **Left**: The original CT scan slice with the predicted pathology and confidence.
* **Right**: A clean, color-coded horizontal bar chart displaying probabilities for all 4 categories.

### 7.3 Testing Built-In Sample Scans from the Test Dataset

If you want to test verified clinical samples of each cancer type from the holdout dataset, run:

```powershell
# Test an Adenocarcinoma scan:
python inference.py "Lung-cancer-model-train/dataset/test/adenocarcinoma/000109 (2).png"

# Test a Large Cell Carcinoma scan:
python inference.py "Lung-cancer-model-train/dataset/test/large.cell.carcinoma/000110.png"

# Test a Squamous Cell Carcinoma scan:
python inference.py "Lung-cancer-model-train/dataset/test/squamous.cell.carcinoma/000111.png"

# Test a Normal (Healthy Lung) scan:
python inference.py "Lung-cancer-model-train/dataset/test/normal/10.png"
```

### 7.4 Troubleshooting Common Questions

| Issue | Cause | Easy Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'` | Terminal is using default system Python (e.g. Python 3.14) instead of the project environment. | Run `conda activate brinjal_gpu` first, or run directly using the full path: `& "C:\Users\pc\anaconda3\envs\brinjal_gpu\python.exe" inference.py your_image.png` |
| `Image file does not exist` | Typo in the file path or wrong file extension (e.g. `.jpeg` vs `.jpg`). | Check the exact filename in Windows Explorer. Or simply drop the file into the root folder and run `python inference.py`. |
| Scan appears completely black | CT scan was saved in a mediastinal window rather than a lung window. | The model's CLAHE module handles variable contrast automatically, but for optimal nodule analysis, standard lung window CTs (window width: 1500 HU, window level: -600 HU) are recommended. |
